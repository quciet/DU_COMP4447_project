# Explore Movie Sales (China/ North America)


## 1. Project objective
- Using techniques from data science tools class to do an analysis on Chinese movie market. Objective includes but not limited to see the sales trend, which actors/actresses/directors/filming companies/distribution companies are the money machines, etc. 

## 2.Instruction
- The working folder is to store all the intermediate works (including Python code, temproary data files...).
- Please directly refer to the "Final Report.ipynb" for the report for this project which includes introduction, process description, analysis and visulization.

- Combined Python code has been provided in the file "Final_Project_Codes_Combined.ipynb". You can use this file to entirely reverse engineering the results shown in the final report. 
- Note that web-scraping part in the code could take a long time to run. Thus, scraped data has been stored and provided in the folder "data" which also contains dataset for each stage (raw, cleaned, subsets for analysis or visulization)
